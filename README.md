# Use case
Develop an AI-powered system that can automatically schedule and distribute surveys to users based on their availability, preferences, and other factors. The system could use machine learning algorithms and GPT-3's language generation capabilities to generate targeted and engaging messages, improving the overall response rate and providing a more comprehensive view of survey results

# Approach
By avoiding the tedious and mundane tasks of creating flat files, uploading them to Qualtrics, and scheduling distributions, you can use Python in conjunction with Qualtrics and the Windows Task Scheduler to automate the entire investigation process. This guide walks you through all the required settings in Qualtrics, including survey design, email message templates, API login tokens, and more. Then the Python Qualtrics mailer program is started and inserts user-specific settings such as: For example, the name of the survey, the subject of the email, the date and time when the survey will be sent, and so on.
